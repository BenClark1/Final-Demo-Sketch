# Egg Transporter Robot

This project is the final sketch for the robot demonstration in EE151 at Cal Poly. The robot is controlled with an Arduino Mega and it can autonomously follow a curving black line, detect obstacles, play musical notes, and control a two-door mechanical system for dispensing an egg into a cup. The program is set up for the robot to avoid one obstacle, then expect the end of the line where the egg will be dispensed.

### Deployment
In order to deploy this sketch, you will need to wire up all of your components using the same pins that I used. My robot had two PWM (pulse width modulated) motors for two front wheels, and one non-motorized roller in the back.
