# Egg Transporter Robot

This program was written for an egg transporter robot. The robot is controlled with an Arduino Mega and it can autonomously follow a curving black line, detect obstacles, play musical notes, and control a two-door mechanical system for dispensing an egg into a cup. The program is set up for the robot to avoid one obstacle, then expect the end of the line where the egg will be dispensed.

I am always trying to learn from my mistakes, so please [provide feedback or suggestions for improvement](https://github.com/BenClark1/Final-Demo-Sketch/issues). Your input is much appreciated.

### Usage
You'll need Arduino hardware and the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software). You'll also need to wire up all of your components using the same pins that I used or change the pin numbers in the code. My robot had two PWM (pulse width modulated) motors for two front wheels, and one non-motorized roller in the back.
